# 7Labs PHP IRC Bot
This project has been forked from super3/IRC-Bot. The original author has been credited for his work and will all credits will remain intact for future releases. Please be aware that this IRC Bot does not have the same functionality as WildPHP and will behave differently.

## Introduction
7Labs PHP IRC Bot was developed as means to connect with another project called AIML Interepter which parses AIML documents and provides responses to the user based on machine learning. The IRC Bot will connect to a specified IRC network, identify itself with Nickserv, and then attempt to join a channel based on configuration. After joining the channel the bot will behave similarly to super3's bot with some various differences. When given the prefix (.) and command <strong>ai</strong> followed by some response to the artificial intelligence (How are you today?) the IRC bot will then access our interepter's API and parse the results via JSON.
